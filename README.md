## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up an OAuth2 Resource Server using Spring Security 6.
- This lesson configuring the server so that it receives an opaque token and asks the authorization server for user authorities using the introspection endpoint.
- In achieving this:
    - The OAuth2 Authorization Server from lesson 13 was used.
    - The opaque token was configured.
    - The introspection uri and client credentials was added.
